## English

I have heard of "saturated fat", "unsaturated fat", "high-density lipoprotein" (HDL), "low-density lipoprotein" (LDL) many times but have never known and cared which are good and bad respectively. I thought my exercise habit can burn everything and I can eat anything without much concern.

In a recent annual physical exam, my LDL (bad cholesterol) was 107 mg/dL, higher than the suggested maximum -- 100 mg/dL. The doctor said that high LDL is caused by diet.

Although it does not exceed much, it is still an alarm. I googled those terminologies above to learn about them. In short, trans fat, saturated fat and cholesterol increases LDL.

After that, I acquired the superpower to see through the amount of "cholesterol" and "saturated fat" inside foods. Before, I spread a big block of butter on bread. Now, plain bread just works. Before, I drank whole milk like usual milk. Now, I reduce my whole milk intake.

## 中文

由細到大，「飽和脂肪」，「不飽和脂肪」，「高密度膽固醇」，「低密度膽固醇」等名詞聽就聽得多，哪個好哪個壞從來沒有搞清楚過，自以為有小小運動習慣就大晒，什麽都能消耗，什麽都能吃。

直到最近身體檢查，LDL（壞膽固醇） 107 mg/dL，超過建議最大值 100 mg/dL。醫生說，壞膽固醇是吃出來的。

雖然不是超很多，但亦都是個警號。事後再 Google 一下，認真認識一下上面的幾個名詞，及其好壞。簡單來說，「反式脂肪」，「飽和脂肪」和「膽固醇」都會提高 LDL。

從此，好像有了透視眼，會自動看到食物的「膽固醇」，「飽和脂肪」含量。以前一大塊牛油塗麵包，現在淨麵包都幾好味；以前全脂奶當奶喝，現在少喝。
