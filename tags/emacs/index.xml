      <description>As mentioned in the last post, I switched to Org-Mode. I kept adjusting my workflow with this new tool and it has been stabilized for a month. I think it is time to talk about the new workflow for task/time management with Org-Mode. This blog post consists of four parts: the principles, the definitions, the workflows, and finally the implementations.
1 The Principles Principles remain valid no matter what the tool is.</description>

      <description>Since 2017, Evernote has been my productivity system for note-taking and task management. I thought it was my ultimate system to stick with. It has served me so well and I have even became a paid user. However, mentioned in the last post, I am pursuing more privacy in my digital life and Evernote becomes a loophole.
 This post talks about the privacy concern, my research on the alternatives, and the switch to Org-Mode.</description>
